# Overview


# Introduction
In its early years, the digital humanities were characterized by many projects that emphasized form over content, as digital humanists built tools that lived in (sometimes) splendid isolation, subject to natural selection. The Linked Open Data approach tends to be more skeptical about tool building, suggesting that the payoff on investment in tool development is often limited. This approach prioritizes the distribution of content itself, preferring to work with existing tools and initiatives rather than to create new ones. Sustainability, usefulness, and collaboration can be enhanced when digital humanists work with an assemblage of existing, supported tools and techniques rather than inventing their own.
