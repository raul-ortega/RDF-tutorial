# RDF-tutorial
RDF tutorial for programminghistorian.org.

I'm beginning to draft this for review. It aims to offer simple steps for a historian to convert data from an abiguously-formatted source into an RDF modeled dataset.

Matthew Lincoln's programminghistorian SPARQL tutorial explains how to access existing databases (catalogs, especially) that are written in RDF format. This tutorial is about building small RDF databases. A future tutorial will show how to produce an RDF database from an existing table via OpenRefine, focusing on skeleton/schema description.
