- links to wikipedia added
- Neo4j described as database. I did not link to the SPARQL plugin--I think my suggestion that it doesn't provide "ready access" to open RDF standards is at least somewhat accurate. Obviously this is debatable, but for the purposes of the lesson simple open formats seem appropriate.
- Re XML: You are right that my assertion that XML would require an elaborate customized schema is careless. (Though my own experience with TEI, mostly with historical newspapers, suggests that it's yet not a complete standard for non-literary purposes.) I've moderated my statement--but I think it's true that it would be a lot of work (and not a great investment) to start learning TEI from scratch only in order to transcribe a name register.
- Thank you for the suggestion to say more about custom v standard vocabularies early and often. Done.
- I have corrected my statement that all RDF documents require declarations, and that Turtle declarations are triples.
- In order to keep things simple, I have not woven in reference to the two very germane vocabularies you mention, but may do so if/when I write a follow up on schema/ontology.
- I've replaced mention of SPARQL endpoint with REST API. I'm grateful for the two posts you provided--helpful to the benighted.

- para. 1 and 2: changed as suggested. Thank you.
- para. 4: You are right that this terminology is off-putting and does not reappear. What I've listed are the half-dozen or so terms that beset (and confuse) any newcomer (me) reading around the topic almost immediately. My aim is to reassure newcomers that they can start using the approach before understanding it in the abstract. I've tweaked the first sentence to make this aim clearer. What do you think?
- I retitled "An example" as "The problem of storing structured historical data"
- 



Problems:
- paragraph 55: can I retain original information, show inferences?
