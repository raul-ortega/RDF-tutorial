Note: Matthew Lincoln's programminghistorian SPARQL tutorial explains how to access existing databases (catalogs, especially) that are written in RDF format. This tutorial is about building small RDF databases. A future tutorial will show how to produce an RDF database from an existing table via OpenRefine, focusing on skeleton/schema description.

# Making a small RDF database

When I'm in the archives, I often come across serial records of some sort--lists, stacks of forms, handwritten and corrected indexes--that I wish to record. One way to do this is an word document: efficient, but not very powerful. It's much easier to count, alphabetize, or otherwise manipulate this data if I record it in a spreadsheet or database program like Filemaker or Access. Often, however, it's not clear to me what fields I should use to record the data. First name/last name, or whole name? Some dates are exact, others are just years, and sometimes an age is given. Sometimes the types of data shift over time. All of this means that I have to change my database, and go back over records I've already read, or leave the series incomplete.
